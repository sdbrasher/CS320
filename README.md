Classwork for CS320 - Software Test Automation 

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Functional software and secure software are two distinct, but related, concepts. I ensure my software is functional by verifying it conforms to stated requirements.
This can be done through static and dynamic analysis, but relies heavily on properly formed requirements. Software security can be confirmed via a variety of methods
including static and dynamic testing.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

For this project, I worked with several design choices and played with aligning user needs with the logic of those designs. For example, one requirement was the abiliity
to remove and update contacts from an in-memory database. I ultimately decided on a list interface after going over several different structures.

How do I approach designing software?

Over the course of my studies, I have learned to approach software development with a mind for security and testing. I do believe, additionally, that the most important
phases of development are the elicitation and analysis of requirements. Whether or not the software is secure, if it is not functional in the way the user desires, it
is nearly useless.
